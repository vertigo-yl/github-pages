## Setup

Create an Rmarkdown document in which you calculate the CLV for each of the plans over an 8 week periods. The relevant data is in `data/pentathlon-II.xls` Also, use the average subscription churn and revenue numbers provided in `data/pentathlon-II-avg.csv` to simulate the effect of the different email frequencies over a 104 week period and generate a line plot to compare the five CLV curves. Are your results consistent with your answer to question 3 in the pentathlon-II.pdf file on Dropbox? Why (or why not)?

## Hints

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. Go to http://commonmark.org/help/ for a 10-minute interactive Markdown tutorial

## Analysis

Load both the `data/pentathlon-II.xls` and `data/pentathlon-II-avg.csv` for use in your analysis. Note that you still have to calculate the weekly discount rate based on the annual discount rate mentioned below.

The variables in `data/pentathlon-II-avg.csv` are:

* `schurn` is the average subscription churn over the 8 weeks of the test
* `rev_sub` is the average revenue from subscribers
* `rev_unsub` is the average revenue from non-subscribers

A few assumptions to start with:

```
weeks <- 1:104
discount <- .1 ## annual discount rate
cogs <- .6
```

Create a code chunk that contains a function that you can call to calculate the CLV for each of the 5 email plans.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(lubridate)
library(DBI)
library(readxl)
library(RSQLite)
library(dbplyr)
library(ggplot2)

pentathlon <- read_excel('data/pentathlon-II.xls')
pentathlon_avg <- read.csv('data/pentathlon-II-avg.csv')


## insert CLV function below
## determine what arguments the function needs to generate the required
weeks <- 1:104
times <- 1:8
discount <- .1 ## annual discount rate
weekly_discount_rate <- (1 + discount)^(1/48) - 1
cogs <- .6

weekly_churn <- tibble::tibble(
  email1 = c(pentathlon[1,2:9]),
  email2 = c(pentathlon[6,2:9]),
  email3 = c(pentathlon[11,2:9]),
  email4 = c(pentathlon[16,2:9]),
  email5 = c(pentathlon[21,2:9])
)

weekly_sub_revenue <-tibble::tibble(
  email1 = c(pentathlon[2,2:9]),
  email2 = c(pentathlon[7,2:9]),
  email3 = c(pentathlon[12,2:9]),
  email4 = c(pentathlon[17,2:9]),
  email5 = c(pentathlon[22,2:9])
)
  
weekly_unsub_revenue <-tibble::tibble(
  email1 = c(pentathlon[3,2:9]),
  email2 = c(pentathlon[8,2:9]),
  email3 = c(pentathlon[13,2:9]),
  email4 = c(pentathlon[18,2:9]),
  email5 = c(pentathlon[23,2:9])
)

## return value
clv <- function(churn_rate,sub_revenue,unsub_revenue,discount_rate,time) {
 profit <- as.numeric(sub_revenue) * (1-cogs) * churn_rate + as.numeric(unsub_revenue) * (1-cogs) * (1-churn_rate)
 exp_profit <- profit / (1 + discount_rate)^(time - 1)
 CLV <- cumsum(exp_profit)
 return(CLV)
}

## email1
churn1 <- c(1,cumprod(1-as.numeric(weekly_churn$email1[c(-1,-9)])))
CLV1 <- clv(churn1,weekly_sub_revenue$email1,weekly_unsub_revenue$email1,weekly_discount_rate,times)
## email2
churn2 <- c(1,cumprod(1-as.numeric(weekly_churn$email2[c(-1,-9)])))
CLV2 <- clv(churn2,weekly_sub_revenue$email2,weekly_unsub_revenue$email2,weekly_discount_rate,times)
## email3
churn3 <- c(1,cumprod(1-as.numeric(weekly_churn$email3[c(-1,-9)])))
CLV3 <- clv(churn3,weekly_sub_revenue$email3,weekly_unsub_revenue$email3,weekly_discount_rate,times)
## email4
churn4 <- c(1,cumprod(1-as.numeric(weekly_churn$email4[c(-1,-9)])))
CLV4 <- clv(churn4,weekly_sub_revenue$email4,weekly_unsub_revenue$email4,weekly_discount_rate,times)
## email5
churn5 <- c(1,cumprod(1-as.numeric(weekly_churn$email5[c(-1,-9)])))
CLV5 <- clv(churn5,weekly_sub_revenue$email5,weekly_unsub_revenue$email5,weekly_discount_rate,times)


## weeks 1-52
time2 <- 1:52
CLV52 <- data.frame(week=time2)
for(i in c(1:5)){
  sub_revenues <- rep(pentathlon_avg$rev_sub[i], 52)
  unsub_revenues <- rep(pentathlon_avg$rev_unsub[i], 52)
  active <- (1 - as.numeric(pentathlon_avg$schurn[i]))^(time2 - 1)
  active_avg <- (active + dplyr::lag(active, default = 1)) / 2
  CLV52[paste("email",i, sep="") ] <- clv(active_avg,sub_revenues,unsub_revenues,weekly_discount_rate,time2)
}

## weeks 1-104
time3 <- 1:104
CLV104 <- data.frame(week=time3)
for(i in c(1:5)){
  sub_revenues <- rep(pentathlon_avg$rev_sub[i], 104)
  unsub_revenues <- rep(pentathlon_avg$rev_unsub[i], 104)
  active <- (1 - as.numeric(pentathlon_avg$schurn[i]))^(time3 - 1)
  active_avg <- (active + dplyr::lag(active, default = 1)) / 2
  CLV104[paste("email",i, sep="") ] <- clv(active_avg,sub_revenues,unsub_revenues,weekly_discount_rate,time3)
}


```

Next, create a tibble with 6 columns. Five columns for the CLV series for each of the plans and one column for the `weeks` variable defined above. Call the `clv` function you created above to fill-in the columns.

```{r}
## create the tibble (data.frame)
weekly <- tibble::tibble(
  week = c(times),
  email1 = CLV1,
  email2 = CLV2,
  email3 = CLV3,
  email4 = CLV4,
  email5 = CLV5
)

```

Next, generate three line plots that compare the CLV curves for each of the five plans. The first graphs should plot weeks 1 through 8. The second graph should plot weeks 1 through 52 and the final graph should show weeks 1 through 104.

```{r}
## generate graph 1
ggplot(weekly) + 
  geom_line(aes(x=week,y=email1),size=0.5,color='red') +
  geom_line(aes(x=week,y=email2),size=0.5,color='green') + 
  geom_line(aes(x=week,y=email3),size=0.5) + 
  geom_line(aes(x=week,y=email4),size=0.5, color ='blue') + 
  geom_line(aes(x=week,y=email5),size=0.5, color = 'purple') 
```

```{r}
## generate graph 2
ggplot(CLV52) + 
  geom_line(aes(x=week,y=email1),size=0.5,color='red') +
  geom_line(aes(x=week,y=email2),size=0.5,color='green') + 
  geom_line(aes(x=week,y=email3),size=0.5) + 
  geom_line(aes(x=week,y=email4),size=0.5, color ='blue') + 
  geom_line(aes(x=week,y=email5),size=0.5, color = 'purple') 
```

```{r}
## generate graph 3
ggplot(CLV104) + 
  geom_line(aes(x=week,y=email1),size=0.5,color='red') +
  geom_line(aes(x=week,y=email2),size=0.5,color='green') + 
  geom_line(aes(x=week,y=email3),size=0.5) + 
  geom_line(aes(x=week,y=email4),size=0.5, color ='blue') + 
  geom_line(aes(x=week,y=email5),size=0.5, color = 'purple') 

```


1)
```{r}
weekly
```


2)
Pentathlon should choose 2 or 3 emails per week, because the LTV is the largest.

3)
I will choose 2 emails per week in the long term, because during week1 to week8, 2 emails per week's profits are always more than 3 emails per week.

4)
It's consistent with my answer in q3.
```{r}
CLV104
```

5)
First, we did not consider the growth of revenue, just use the average of the first 8 weeks, which is not accurate.
Then, we should use the simulation to forecast the distribution of revenue in the future.
